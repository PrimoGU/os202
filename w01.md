# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Intellectual Property Rights](https://freibrunlaw.com/intellectual-property-rights-software-protect/#:~:text=There%20are%20essentially%20four%20types,to%20protect%20the%20technology%20itself.)<br>
There are essentially four types of intellectual property rights relevant to software: patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks. Each affords a different type of legal protection. Patents, copyrights and trade secrets can be used to protect the technology itself. Trademarks do not protect technology, but the names or symbols used to distinguish a product in the marketplace. <br>

2. [User Operating System Interface](http://www.padakuu.com/article/84-user-os-interface-command-interpreter-and-graphical-user-interfaces)<br>
There are two fundamental approaches for users to interface with the operating system. One technique is to provide a command-line interface or command interpreter that allows users to directly enter commands that are to be performed by the operating system. The second approach allows the user to interface with the operating system via a graphical user interface or GUI. <br>

3. [System Call in OS](https://www.guru99.com/system-call-operating-system.html)<br>
A system call is a mechanism that provides the interface between a process and the operating system. It is a programmatic method in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the OS. <br>

4. [System Programs in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-programs-in-operating-system/)<br>
According to Computer Hierarchy, one which comes at last is Hardware. Then it is Operating System, System Programs, and finally Application Programs. Program Development and Execution can be done conveniently in System Programs. Some of System Programs are simply user interfaces, others are complex. It traditionally lies between user interface and system calls. <br>

5. [Operating System Design & Implementation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating-system-design-and-implementation)<br>
Operating system by itself does not provide any function but it provides an atmosphere in which different applications and programs can do useful work. There are many problems that can occur while designing and implementing an operating system. These are covered in operating system design and implementation. <br>

6. [Operating System Structures](http://faculty.salina.k-state.edu/tim/ossg/Introduction/struct.html)<br>
Since the operating system is such a complex structure, it should be created with utmost care so it can be used and modified easily. An easy way to do this is to create the operating system in parts. Each of these parts should be well defined with clear inputs, outputs and functions. <br>
