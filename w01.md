# Top 10 List of Week 01

1. [Intellectual Property Rights](https://freibrunlaw.com/intellectual-property-rights-software-protect/#:~:text=There%20are%20essentially%20four%20types,to%20protect%20the%20technology%20itself.)<br>

The second approach allows the user to interface with the operating system via a graphical user interface or GUI. <br>
