# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. **[What is Process Synchronization?](https://www.guru99.com/process-synchronization.html)** <br>
Process Synchronization is the task of coordinating the execution of processes in a way that no two processes can have access to the same shared data and resources. It is specially needed in a multi-process system when multiple processes are running together, and more than one processes try to gain access to the same shared resource or data at the same time. This can lead to the inconsistency of shared data. So the change made by one process not necessarily reflected when other processes accessed the same shared data. To avoid this type of inconsistency of data, the processes need to be synchronized with each other. <br>

2. **[Classical Problems of Synchronization](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-process-states)** <br>
Here are some of the classical problem depicting flaws of process synchronaization in systems where cooperating processes are present: **1. Bounded Buffer (Producer-Consumer) Problem**, **2. Dining Philosophers Problem**, and **3. The Readers Writers Problem**. <br>

3. **[The Critical Section Problem](https://www.guru99.com/process-synchronization.html#4)** <br>
A critical section is a segment of code which can be accessed by a signal process at a specific point of time. The section consists of shared data resources that required to be accessed by other processes. The entry to the critical section is handled by the wait() function, and it is represented as P(). The exit from a critical section is controlled by the signal() function, represented as V(). In the critical section, only a single process can be executed. Other processes, waiting to execute their critical section, need to wait until the current process completes its execution. <br>

4. **[Peterson’s Algorithm in Process Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/petersons-algorithm-in-process-synchronization/)** <br>
The producer consumer problem (or bounded buffer problem) describes two processes, the producer and the consumer, which share a common, fixed-size buffer used as a queue. Producer produce an item and put it into buffer. If buffer is already full then producer will have to wait for an empty block in buffer. Consumer consume an item from buffer. If buffer is already empty then consumer will have to wait for an item in buffer. Implement Peterson’s Algorithm for the two processes using shared memory such that there is mutual exclusion between them. The solution should have free from synchronization problems. <br>

5. **[What is Semaphore?](https://www.guru99.com/semaphore-in-operating-system.html)** <br>
Semaphore is simply a variable that is non-negative and shared between threads. A semaphore is a signaling mechanism, and a thread that is waiting on a semaphore can be signaled by another thread. It uses two atomic operations, 1)wait, and 2) signal for the process synchronization. A semaphore either allows or disallows access to the resource, which depends on how it is set up. The two common kinds of semaphores are **Counting semaphores** & **Binary semaphores**. <br>

6. **[What is Context Switching in Operating System?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-context-switching-in-operating-system)** <br>
A context switching is a process that involves switching of the CPU from one process or task to another. In this phenomenon, the execution of the process that is present in the running state is suspended by the kernel and another process that is present in the ready state is executed by the CPU. It is one of the essential features of the multitasking operating system. The processes are switched so fastly that it gives an illusion to the user that all the processes are being executed at the same time. <br>

7. **[Process Creation vs Process Termination](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-creation-vs-process-termination-in-operating-system)** <br>
A process may be created by another process using fork(). The creating process is called the parent process and the created process is the child process. A child process can have only one parent but a parent process may have many children. Both the parent and child processes have the same memory image, open files and environment strings. However, they have distinct address spaces. Process termination occurs when the process is terminated The exit() system call is used by most operating systems for process termination. <br>

8. **[Role of Interrupts](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/What-is-caching)** <br>
Interrupts are signals sent to the CPU by external devices, normally I/O devices. They tell the CPU to stop its current activities and execute the appropriate part of the operating system. There are three types of interrupts: **Hardware Interupts**, **Software Interupts**, and **Traps**. Interrupts are important because they give the user better control over the computer. Without interrupts, a user may have to wait for a given application to have a higher priority over the CPU to be ran. This ensures that the CPU will deal with the process immediately. <br>

9. **[What is Inter Process Communication (IPC)?](https://www.guru99.com/inter-process-communication-ipc.html)** <br>
Inter process communication (IPC) is used for exchanging data between multiple threads in one or more processes or programs. The Processes may be running on single or multiple computers connected by a network. The full form of IPC is Inter-process communication. It is a set of programming interface which allow a programmer to coordinate activities among various program processes which can run concurrently in an operating system. This allows a specific program to handle many user requests at the same time. <br>

10. **[What are Threads?](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/multithreading)** <br>
Thread is an execution unit which consists of its own program counter, a stack, and a set of registers. Threads are also known as Lightweight processes. Threads are popular way to improve application through parallelism. The CPU switches rapidly back and forth among the threads giving illusion that the threads are running in parallel. As each thread has its own independent resource for process execution, multpile processes can be executed parallely by increasing number of threads. <br>
