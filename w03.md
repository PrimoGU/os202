# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. **[File Access Methods](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-file-access-methods)** <br>
There are three ways to access a file into a computer system: **Sequential Access**, **Direct Access**, and **Indexed Access** methods. <br> <br>
In **Sequential Access**, the OS read the file word by word. A pointer is maintained which initially points to the base address of the file. If the user wants to read first word of the file then the pointer provides that word to the user and increases its value by 1 word. This process continues till the end of the file. <br> <br>
The **Direct Access** method is mostly required in the case of database systems. In most of the cases, we need filtered information from the database. Direct access will give the required result despite the fact that the operating system has to perform some complex tasks. <br> <br>
The **Indexed Access** method constructs an index for the file. The index, like an index in the back of a book, contains the pointer to the various blocks. To find a record in the file, we first search the index and then by the help of pointer we access the file directly. <br>

2. **[Concept of Single Level Directory](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-single-level-directory)**<br>
The simplest method is to have one big list of all the files on the disk. The entire system will contain only one directory which is supposed to mention all the files present in the file system. The directory contains one entry per each file present on the file system. <br> <br>
**Advantages:** Since it is a single directory, its implementation is very easy. If the files are smaller in size, searching will become faster. The operations like file creation, searching, deletion, updating are very easy in such a directory structure. <br> <br>
**Disadvantages:** We cannot have two files with the same name. If the directory is big, searching for a file may take so much time. Protection cannot be implemented for multiple users. There are no ways to group same kind of files. <br>

3. **[Concept of Two Level Directory](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-two-level-directory)**<br>
In two level directory systems, we can create a separate directory for each user. There is one master directory which contains separate directories dedicated to each user. For each user, there is a different directory present at the second level, containing group of user's file. <br> <br>
**Advantages:** Each file has a full path name like "/User-name/directory-name/". Different users can have the same file name. Searching becomes more efficient as only one user's list needs to be traversed. <br> <br>
**Disadvantages:** A user is not allowed to share files with other users. Still it not very scalable, two files of the same type cannot be grouped together in the same user. <br>

4. **[Concept of Tree-Structured Directory](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-tree-structured-directory)**<br>
In Tree structured directory system, any directory entry can either be a file or sub directory. Tree structured directory system overcomes the drawbacks of two level directory system. The similar kind of files can now be grouped in one directory. <br> <br>
**Advantages:** Very generalize, since full path name can be given. Very scalable, the probability of name collision is less. Searching becomes very easy, we can use both absolute path as well as relative. <br> <br>
**Disadvantages:** Every file does not fit into the hierarchical model, files may be saved into multiple directories. We still can not share files. It is inefficient, because accessing a file may go under multiple directories. <br>

5. **[Concept of Acyclic-Graph Structured Directory](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-acyclic-graph-directories)** <br>
An acyclic graph is a graph with no cycle and allows to share subdirectories and files. In this system, two or more directory entry can point to the same file or sub directory. That file or sub directory is shared between the two directory entries. <br> <br>
**Advantages:** We can share files. Searching is easy due to different-different paths. <br> <br>
**Disadvantages:** We share the files via linking, just in case deleting it may create the problem> If the link is softlink then after deleting the file we left with a dangling pointer. In case of hardlink, to delete a file we have to delete all the reference associated with it. <br>

6. **[File System Implementation in Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-file-system-structure)** <br>
File System provide efficient access to the disk by allowing data to be stored, located and retrieved in a convenient way. A file System must be able to store the file, locate the file and retrieve the file. Most Operating Systems use layering approach for every task including file systems. Every layer of the file system is responsible for some activities. <br> <br>
**Logical File System :** When an application program asks for a file, the first request is directed to the logical file system. The logical file system contains the Meta data of the file and directory structure. <br> <br>
**File Organization Module :** In order to store and retrieve the files, the logical blocks need to be mapped to physical blocks. This mapping is done by File organization module. It is also responsible for free space management. <br> <br>
**Basic File System :** The basic file system is responsible for issuing the commands to I/O control in order to fetch those blocks. <br> <br>
**I/O Control :** I/O controls contain the codes by using which it can access hard disk. These codes are known as device drivers. I/O controls are also responsible for handling interrupts. <br>

7. **[Directory Implementation in Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-directory-implementation)** <br>
Authentication refers to identifying each user of the system and associating the executing programs with those users. It is the responsibility of the Operating System to create a protection system which ensures that a user who is running a particular program is authentic. Operating Systems generally identifies/authenticates users using the following ways: Passwords (Encrypted & One-Time), Generated Keys, or Biometrics. <br>

8. **[Implementing Security Defenses](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/15_Security.html#:~:text=Implementing%20Security%20Defenses,Tripwire%20Filesystem)** <br>
Just as there are myriad threats to system and network security, there are many security solutions. The solutions range fromimproved user education, through technology, towriting better software.Most security professionals subscribe to the theory of defense in depth, which states that more layers of defense are better than fewer layers. The steps in implementing good security defenses are: Security Policy, Vulnerability Assessment, Intrusion Prevention, Virus Protection, Auditing, and Firewalling. <br>

9. **[The Beginnerâ€™s Guide To Online Privacy](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-online-privacy-7149b33c4a3e/)** <br>
With cybercrime constantly on the rise and an ever-growing number of security breaches reported even (or especially) by online behemoths such as Facebook, the need for healthy privacy habits on the internet is more important than ever. Individuals and businesses alike risk exposing private information at every step in their online activities, whether by not using proper security practices or by unwillingly falling victim to identity hacks or phishing scams. <br>

10. **[Why Linux is Better than Windows or macOS for Security](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3252823/why-linux-is-better-than-windows-or-macos-for-security.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CLinux%20is%20the%20most%20secure,to%20the%20information%20security%20world.)** <br>
Linux is the most secure OS, as its source is open. Anyone can review it and make sure there are no bugs or back doors. Linux and Unix-based operating systems have less exploitable security flaws known to the information security world. Linux code is reviewed by the tech community, which lends itself to security: By having that much oversight, there are fewer vulnerabilities, bugs and threats. <br>
