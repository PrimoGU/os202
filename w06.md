# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. **[Process Management](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_processes.htm)** <br>
A process is basically a program in execution. The execution of a process must progress in a sequential fashion. A process is defined as an entity which represents the basic unit of work to be implemented in the system. To put it in simple terms, we write our computer programs in a text file and when we execute this program, it becomes a process which performs all the tasks mentioned in the program. When a program is loaded into the memory and it becomes a process, it can be divided into four sections â”€ stack, heap, text and data. <br>

2. **[States of a Process in Operating Systems](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-process-states)** <br>
The process, from its creation to completion, passes through various states, which are: **1) New:** Newly Created Process or being-created process; **2) Ready:** After creation process moves to Ready state, i.e. the process is ready for execution; **3) Run:** Currently running process in CPU (only one process at a time can be under execution in a single processor); **4) Wait/Block:** When a process requests I/O access; **5) Complete/Terminated:** The process completed its execution; **6) Suspended Ready:** When the ready queue becomes full, some processes are moved to suspended ready state; **7) Suspended Block:** When waiting queue becomes full.<br>

3. **[What is Process Scheduling?](https://www.guru99.com/process-scheduling.html)** <br>
Process Scheduling is an OS task that schedules processes of different states like ready, waiting, and running. Process scheduling allows OS to allocate a time interval of CPU execution for each process. Another important reason for using a process scheduling system is that it keeps the CPU busy all the time. This allows you to get the minimum response time for programs. There are mainly three types of Process Schedulers: Long Term, Short Term, and Medium Term. <br>

4. **[What is Context Switching in Operating System?](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-context-switching-in-operating-system)** <br>
A context switching is a process that involves switching of the CPU from one process or task to another. In this phenomenon, the execution of the process that is present in the running state is suspended by the kernel and another process that is present in the ready state is executed by the CPU. It is one of the essential features of the multitasking operating system. The processes are switched so fastly that it gives an illusion to the user that all the processes are being executed at the same time. <br>

5. **[Process Creation vs Process Termination](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/process-creation-vs-process-termination-in-operating-system)** <br>
A process may be created by another process using fork(). The creating process is called the parent process and the created process is the child process. A child process can have only one parent but a parent process may have many children. Both the parent and child processes have the same memory image, open files and environment strings. However, they have distinct address spaces. Process termination occurs when the process is terminated The exit() system call is used by most operating systems for process termination. <br>

6. **[What is Caching?](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/What-is-caching)** <br>
Cache is a type of memory that is used to increase the speed of data access. Normally, the data required for any process resides in the main memory. However, it is transferred to the cache memory temporarily if it is used frequently enough. The process of storing and accessing data from a cache is known as caching. <br>

7. **[Memory Allocation in OS](https://binaryterms.com/static-and-dynamic-memory-allocation.html)** <br>
Memory allocation is an action of assigning the physical or the virtual memory address space to a process (its instructions and data). The two fundamental methods of memory allocation are static and dynamic memory allocation. **Static memory allocation** method assigns the memory to a process, before its execution. On the other hand, the **dynamic memory allocation** method assigns the memory to a process, during its execution. <br>

8. **[Allocation of Frames in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)** <br>
An important aspect of operating systems, virtual memory is implemented using demand paging. Demand paging necessitates the development of a page-replacement algorithm and a frame allocation algorithm. Frame allocation algorithms are used if you have multiple processes; it helps decide how many frames to allocate to each process. <br>

9. **[Priority Allocation / Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/priority-scheduling-program.html)** <br>
Priority Scheduling is a method of scheduling processes that is based on priority. In this algorithm, the scheduler selects the tasks to work as per the priority. The processes with higher priority should be carried out first, whereas jobs with equal priorities are carried out on a round-robin or FCFS basis. Priority depends upon memory requirements, time requirements, etc. <br>

10. **[Techniques to Handle Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)** <br>
The basic concept involved is that if a process is allocated too few frames, then there will be too many and too frequent page faults. As a result, no useful work would be done by the CPU and the CPU utilisation would fall drastically. The long-term scheduler would then try to improve the CPU utilisation by loading some more processes into the memory thereby increasing the degree of multiprogramming. This would result in a further decrease in the CPU utilization triggering a chained reaction of higher page faults followed by an increase in the degree of multiprogramming, called Thrashing. <br>
