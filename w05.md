# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. **[What is Virtual Memory?](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-memory)** <br>
Virtual memory is a memory management technique where secondary memory can be used as if it were a part of the main memory. Virtual memory is a very common technique used in the operating systems (OS) of computers. Virtual memory uses hardware and software to allow a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages, by temporarily transferring data from random access memory (RAM) to disk storage. In essence, virtual memory allows a computer to treat secondary memory as though it were the main memory. <br>

2. **[What is Demand Paging?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/virtual-memory-in-operating-system/)** <br>
A demand paging system is quite similar to a paging system with swapping where processes reside in secondary memory and pages are loaded only on demand, not in advance. When a context switch occurs, the operating system does not copy any of the old program’s pages out to the disk or any of the new program’s pages into the main memory Instead, it just begins executing the new program after loading the first page and fetches that program’s pages as they are referenced. <br>

3. **[Page Fault Handling in OS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-fault-handling-in-operating-system/)** <br>
Paging is a non-contiguous memory allocation technique. In a paging scheme, a process is divided into several pages. The pages are then stored in different frames of the main memory. When a page referenced by the CPU is not found in the main memory, it is called as a page fault. When a page fault occurs, the required page has to be fetched from the secondary memory into the main memory. <br>

4. **[Page Replacement Algorithms](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)** <br>
Page replacement algorithms are the techniques using which an Operating System decides which memory pages to swap out, write to disk when a page of memory needs to be allocated. Page replacement algorithms help to decide which page must be swapped out from the main memory to create a room for the incoming page. Various page replacement algorithms are: **Reference String**, **First In First Out (FIFO)** algorithm, **Optimal Page** algorithm, **Least Recently Used (LRU)** algorithm, **Page Buffering** algorithm, **Least frequently Used(LFU)** algorithm, and **Most frequently Used(MFU)** algorithm. <br>

5. **[What is Copy on Write (COW)?](https://padakuu.com/article/95-copy-on-write)** <br>
Copy on Write or simply COW is a resource management technique. One of its main use is in the implementation of the fork system call in which it shares the virtual memory(pages) of the OS. In UNIX like OS, fork() system call creates a duplicate process of the parent process which is called as the child process. The idea behind a copy-on-write is that when a parent process creates a child process then both of these processes initially will share the same pages in memory. <br>

6. **[What is Caching?](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/What-is-caching)** <br>
Cache is a type of memory that is used to increase the speed of data access. Normally, the data required for any process resides in the main memory. However, it is transferred to the cache memory temporarily if it is used frequently enough. The process of storing and accessing data from a cache is known as caching. <br>

7. **[Memory Allocation in OS](https://binaryterms.com/static-and-dynamic-memory-allocation.html)** <br>
Memory allocation is an action of assigning the physical or the virtual memory address space to a process (its instructions and data). The two fundamental methods of memory allocation are static and dynamic memory allocation. Static memory allocation method assigns the memory to a process, before its execution. On the other hand, the dynamic memory allocation method assigns the memory to a process, during its execution. <br>

8. **[Segmentation in Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-segmentation)** <br>
Segmentation is a memory management technique in which each job is divided into several segments of different sizes, one for each module that contains pieces that perform related functions. Each segment is actually a different logical address space of the program. When a process is to be executed, its corresponding segmentation are loaded into non-contiguous memory though every segment is loaded into a contiguous block of available memory. Segmentation memory management works very similar to paging but here segments are of variable-length where as in paging pages are of fixed size. <br>

9. **[Logical vs Physical Addressing](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-logical-and-physical-address.html)** <br>
We have two types of addresses that are logical address and physical address. The logical address is a virtual address and can be viewed by the user. The user can’t view the physical address directly. The logical address is used like a reference, to access the physical address. The fundamental difference between logical and physical address is that logical address is generated by CPU during a program execution whereas, the physical address refers to a location in the memory unit. <br>

10. **[Difference Between Loading & Linking](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-loading-and-linking/)** <br>
Linking and Loading are the utility programs that play a important role in the execution of a program. Linking intakes the object codes generated by the assembler and combines them to generate the executable module. On the other hand, the loading loads this executable module to the main memory for execution. <br>
**Loading:** Bringing the program from secondary memory to main memory is called Loading. <br>
**Linking:** Establishing the linking between all the modules or all the functions of the program in order to continue the program execution is called linking. <br>
