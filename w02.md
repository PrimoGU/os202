1. **[Definition â€” What does Operating System Security (OS Security) mean?](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24774/operating-system-security-os-security)**<br>
Operating system security (OS security) is the process of ensuring OS integrity, confidentiality and availability. OS security refers to specified steps or measures used to protect the OS from threats, viruses, worms, malware or remote hacker intrusions. OS security encompasses all preventive-control techniques, which safeguard any computer assets capable of being stolen, edited or deleted if OS security is compromised. <br>

Some of the most common types of violations include: **Breach of Confidentiality** - Theft of private or confidential information; **Breach of Integrity** - Unauthorized modification of data, which may have serious indirect consequences; **Breach of Availability**  - Unauthorized destruction of data, often just for the "fun" of causing havoc and for bragging rites. **Theft of Service** - Unauthorized use of resources; **Denial of Service (DOS)** - Preventing legitimate users from using the system, often by overloading and overwhelming the system with an excess of requests for service. <br>

The 4 levels at which a system must be protected are: **Physical** - The sites containing computer systems must be physically secured against armed and malicious intruders; **Human** - Only appropriate users must have the authorization to access the system. **Operating System** - The system must protect itself from accidental or purposeful security breaches. **Network** - Network should be properly secured against such attacks. <br>
