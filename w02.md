# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. [Definition â€” What does Operating System Security (OS Security) mean?](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24774/operating-system-security-os-security)<br>
Operating system security (OS security) is the process of ensuring OS integrity, confidentiality and availability. OS security refers to specified steps or measures used to protect the OS from threats, viruses, worms, malware or remote hacker intrusions. OS security encompasses all preventive-control techniques, which safeguard any computer assets capable of being stolen, edited or deleted if OS security is compromised. <br>

2. [Common Types of Security Violations](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/15_Security.html)<br>
* Breach of Confidentiality - Theft of private or confidential information, such as credit-card numbers, trade secrets, patents, secret formulas, manufacturing procedures, medical information, financial information, etc.
* Breach of Integrity - Unauthorized modification of data, which may have serious indirect consequences. For example a popular game or other program's source code could be modified to open up security holes on users systems before being released to the public.
* Breach of Availability - Unauthorized destruction of data, often just for the "fun" of causing havoc and for bragging rites. Vandalism of web sites is a common form of this violation.
* Theft of Service - Unauthorized use of resources, such as theft of CPU cycles, installation of daemons running an unauthorized file server, or tapping into the target's telephone or networking services.
* Denial of Service, DOS - Preventing legitimate users from using the system, often by overloading and overwhelming the system with an excess of requests for service. <br>
