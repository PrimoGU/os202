# Top 10 List of Week 02

1. **[Definition â€” What does Operating System Security (OS Security) mean?](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/24774/operating-system-security-os-security)**<br>
Operating system security (OS security) is the process of ensuring OS integrity, confidentiality and availability. OS security refers to specified steps or measures used to protect the OS from threats, viruses, worms, malware or remote hacker intrusions. OS security encompasses all preventive-control techniques, which safeguard any computer assets capable of being stolen, edited or deleted if OS security is compromised. <br>

2. **[Common Types of Security Violations](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/15_Security.html#:~:text=Breach%20of%20Confidentiality,excess%20of%20requests%20for%20service.)**<br>
Some of the most common types of violations include: **Breach of Confidentiality** - Theft of private or confidential information; **Breach of Integrity** - Unauthorized modification of data, which may have serious indirect consequences; **Breach of Availability**  - Unauthorized destruction of data, often just for the "fun" of causing havoc and for bragging rites. **Theft of Service** - Unauthorized use of resources; **Denial of Service (DOS)** - Preventing legitimate users from using the system, often by overloading and overwhelming the system with an excess of requests for service. <br>

3. **[Security Measures Taken to Protect the System](http://www.padakuu.com/article/149-what-is-the-security-problem#:~:text=To%20protect%20a%20system,security%20is%20to%20be%20ensured.)**<br>
The 4 levels at which a system must be protected are: **Physical** - The sites containing computer systems must be physically secured against armed and malicious intruders; **Human** - Only appropriate users must have the authorization to access the system. **Operating System** - The system must protect itself from accidental or purposeful security breaches. **Network** - Network should be properly secured against such attacks. <br>

10. **[Why Linux is Better than Windows or macOS for Security](https://www.computerworld.com/article/3252823/why-linux-is-better-than-windows-or-macos-for-security.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9CLinux%20is%20the%20most%20secure,to%20the%20information%20security%20world.)** <br>
Linux is the most secure OS, as its source is open. Anyone can review it and make sure there are no bugs or back doors. Linux and Unix-based operating systems have less exploitable security flaws known to the information security world. Linux code is reviewed by the tech community, which lends itself to security: By having that much oversight, there are fewer vulnerabilities, bugs and threats. <br>
