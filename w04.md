# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. **[What is Memory Management?](https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-memory-management-requirements-errors-techniques.html)** <br>
Memory management is the functionality of an operating system which handles or manages primary memory and moves processes back and forth between main memory and disk during execution. Memory management keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of either it is allocated to some process or it is free. It checks how much memory is to be allocated to processes. It decides which process will get memory at what time. It tracks whenever some memory gets freed or unallocated and correspondingly it updates the status. <br>

2. **[Contiguous Memory Allocation](https://binaryterms.com/contiguous-memory-allocation-in-operating-system.html)** <br>
Contiguous memory allocation is a memory allocation method that allocates a single contiguous section of memory to a process or a file. This method takes into account the size of the file or a process and also estimates the maximum size. Taking into account the future growth of the file and its request for memory, the operating system allocates sufficient contiguous memory blocks to that file.  Considering this future expansion and the file’s request for memory, the operating system will allocate those many contiguous blocks of memory to that file. <br>

3. **[Paging in Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-paging-with-example)** <br>
In Operating Systems, Paging is a storage mechanism used to retrieve processes from the secondary storage into the main memory in the form of pages. The main idea behind the paging is to divide each process in the form of pages. The main memory will also be divided in the form of frames. One page of the process is to be stored in one of the frames of the memory. The pages can be stored at the different locations of the memory but the priority is always to find the contiguous frames or holes. Pages of the process are brought into the main memory only when they are required otherwise they reside in the secondary storage. <br>

4. **[Segmentation in Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-segmentation)** <br>
Segmentation is a memory management technique in which each job is divided into several segments of different sizes, one for each module that contains pieces that perform related functions. Each segment is actually a different logical address space of the program. When a process is to be executed, its corresponding segmentation are loaded into non-contiguous memory though every segment is loaded into a contiguous block of available memory. Segmentation memory management works very similar to paging but here segments are of variable-length where as in paging pages are of fixed size. <br>

5. **[Logical vs Physical Addressing](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-logical-and-physical-address.html)** <br>
We have two types of addresses that are logical address and physical address. The logical address is a virtual address and can be viewed by the user. The user can’t view the physical address directly. The logical address is used like a reference, to access the physical address. The fundamental difference between logical and physical address is that logical address is generated by CPU during a program execution whereas, the physical address refers to a location in the memory unit. <br>

6. **[First, Best & Worst Fit Allocation Methods](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/partition-allocation-methods-in-memory-management/)** <br>
When there is more than one partition freely available to accommodate a process’s request, a partition must be selected. To choose a particular partition, a partition allocation method is needed. A partition allocation method is considered better if it avoids internal fragmentation. When it is time to load a process into main memory and if there is more than one free block of memory of sufficient size then the OS decide which free block to allocate. There are different Placement Algorithm: First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, and Next Fit. <br>

7. **[Directory Implementation in Operating System](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-directory-implementation)** <br>
The directory implementation algorithms are classified according to the data structure they are using. There are mainly two algorithms which are used in these days. <br> <br>
**Linear List :** In this algorithm, all the files in a directory are maintained as singly lined list. Each file contains the pointers to the data blocks which are assigned to it and the next file in the directory. The list needs to be traversed in case of every operation (creation, deletion, updating, etc) on the files therefore the systems become inefficient. <br> <br>
**Hash Table :** The hash table takes a value computed from the file name and returns a pointer to the file. It decreases the directory search time. The insertion and deletion process of files is easy. The major difficulty of hash tables are its generally fixed size and dependency on hash function on that size. <br>

8. **[What is Access Control?](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/access-control)** <br>
Access control for an operating system determines how the operating system implements accesses to system resources by satisfying the security objectives of integrity, availability, and secrecy. Such a mechanism authorizes subjects (e.g., processes and users) to perform certain operations (e.g., read, write) on objects and resources of the OS (e.g., files, sockets). There are two types of access control: physical and logical. Physical access control limits access to campuses, buildings, rooms and physical IT assets. Logical access control limits connections to computer networks, system files and data. <br>

9. **[What is the Difference Between Relative & Absolute Path?](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001708.htm)** <br>
An absolute or full path points to the same location in a file system, regardless of the current working directory. To do that, it must include the root directory. By contrast, a relative path starts from some given working directory, avoiding the need to provide the full absolute path. A filename can be considered as a relative path based at the current working directory. If the working directory is not the file's parent directory, a file not found error will result if the file is addressed by its name. <br>

10. **[What is a Journaling File System?](https://www.maketecheasier.com/journaling-in-file-system/)** <br>
The purpose of journaling in computing file systems is to keep track of changes not yet committed to the file system. Even after any crashes or unexpected shutdowns, you can still access the latest file version with a lower likelihood of it becoming corrupted. Journaling allows all the updates to a file to be stored in a contiguous portion of the disk. Journaling saves much time in file storage retrieval because of contiguous memory allocations. <br>
